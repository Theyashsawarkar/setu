<!-- No screenshot: bluetooth shows personal data (your own devices). -->

> *Setu* (सेतु) is Sanskrit for "bridge": the bridge between your laptop and your Bluetooth devices.

setu is bluetooth for [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom): one keyboard-driven panel that opens instantly, with live data, a preview and a key for everything. It runs on any compositor with the layer-shell protocol (sway, Hyprland, river, niri, Wayfire, labwc…). In [Vayu](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vayu), the desktop it was built for, it replaces bluetooth-picker.py.

## Features

- Your devices, connected first, each with its **battery level** and the right icon (headphones, mouse, keyboard, phone…).
- **Discovers nearby devices while the panel is open**; nameless beacons are left out.
- `Enter` connects or disconnects; a nearby device **pairs, trusts and connects** in one go.
- Remove (unpair), and a Bluetooth on/off switch.
- Keyboard first: every action has a key, shown in the footer; the mouse works too.
- Never freezes the panel: slow commands run in the background.

## Install

### Requirements

- [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom) 0.2 or newer (Python 3.11+, PyGObject, GTK 4, [gtk4-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell), a Nerd Font)
- `bluetoothctl`

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/setu ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/setu
vyom reload           # pick it up (or log out and in)
vyom setu            # open it; run it again to close
```

Give it a key in your compositor, e.g. sway:

```sh
bindsym $mod+<key> exec vyom setu
```

### Update and uninstall

```sh
git -C ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/setu pull && vyom reload     # update
rm -rf ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/setu && vyom reload          # uninstall
```

## Usage

Open it with `vyom setu` (or your key). Type to search; the footer always shows the keys for what's selected.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Connect or disconnect the selected device (pairs a new one) |
| `Ctrl+P` | Pair and trust the selected device |
| `Ctrl+Backspace` | Remove (unpair) the selected device |
| `Ctrl+B` | Turn Bluetooth on or off |
| `Esc` | Close the panel |

Every Vyom panel also has `Up`/`Down` (or `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+J`) to move, `Page Up`/`Page Down` to jump and `Tab` to switch to the next tool.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing opens.** `vyom list` shows every installed tool, and why one is skipped (a missing requirement, or a Vyom that's too old).
- **It opened, then something failed.** Look for a `Traceback` in the daemon's log, `journalctl --user -u vyom -u vyom-daemon -b` (without systemd: `~/.local/state/vyom/daemon.log`), and [open an issue](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/setu/issues/new/choose) with it.
- **No blur or rounded corners.** That's the compositor: on SwayFX, add `layer_effects "vyom" { blur enable; corner_radius 20; shadows enable }`.
